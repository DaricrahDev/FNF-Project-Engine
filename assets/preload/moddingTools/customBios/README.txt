Characters

Maximun number of characters: 5
When you finish writing the name of a character write :: to change to the next's character name

Rest of the other stuff (descriptions, img)

Descriptions: same thing that seen before in characters section.

Images: just go to 'images/bios' and replace the number of images needed with the order of the characters in the bios menu. 

Example: 

charname: daricrahdev
desc: fnf programmer
img: images/bios/1.png 

// its the first image bc its the first character on the bios menu.

Thanks for using Project Engine!
